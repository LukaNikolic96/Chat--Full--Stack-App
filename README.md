## Real-Time Chat Application

This GitHub repository contains a full-stack real-time chat application built using Node.js for the backend and React.js for the frontend. This project is a feature-rich and scalable chat application that supports group chat, one-on-one chat, real-time message updates, image and file sharing, and read receipts. The UI design of this chat app is visually appealing and stands out as one of the best-looking chat applications in the tech stack of Node.js and React.js.

### Technologies and Languages Used:

1. Node.js: The backend of the chat application is built using Node.js. Node.js is a powerful server-side JavaScript runtime that provides high-performance, non-blocking I/O capabilities, making it well-suited for real-time applications.

2. Express.js: Express is used as an HTTP framework to run the Node.js server. It simplifies handling HTTP requests, routing, and middleware implementation.

3. React.js: The frontend of the chat application is developed using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture facilitates the creation of dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

4. Chat Engine.io: Chat Engine.io is utilized to add chat functionality to the application. It provides full-stack chat tools, including APIs for user management, chat history, and real-time communication.

5. Axios: Axios is a JavaScript library used for making API calls. It is employed in the frontend to interact with the Node.js server and Chat Engine.io API.

### Functionality and Features:

1. User Authentication: The application starts with an authentication page where users can specify a username to sign up or log in. User credentials are validated on the backend to ensure secure access.

2. Real-Time Chat: The chat functionality enables users to engage in real-time conversations with other users. Messages are instantly delivered and displayed to all participants.

3. Group Chat and One-on-One Chat: Users can create group chats and one-on-one chats with other users, fostering both private and collaborative discussions.

4. Support for Mobile and Desktop Apps: The chat application is designed to be responsive and supports both mobile and desktop devices, providing a seamless user experience across different platforms.

5. File and Image Sharing: Users can send images and files to each other, enhancing communication and collaboration within the chat.

6. Read Receipts: The application displays read receipts, indicating when a message has been viewed by the recipient.

7. Scalability: The chat app is scalable and can handle a significant number of users, making it suitable for large-scale implementations.

### How it Works:

1. Node.js Backend: The Node.js server acts as the backend of the chat application. It handles user authentication, user creation, and user data management using Express.js.

2. React.js Frontend: The React.js frontend interacts with the Node.js backend through API calls using Axios. It renders the user interface, allowing users to log in, create chats, send messages, and view chat history.

3. Chat Engine.io Integration: Chat Engine.io is integrated into the application to provide real-time chat functionality. It manages chat sessions, user connections, and message broadcasting between users.

### Getting Started:

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the Node.js backend by navigating to the "backend" directory and installing the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the Node.js server using `npm run start`.
4. Set up the React.js frontend by navigating to the "frontend" directory and installing the required dependencies using `npm install`.
5. Start the React.js development server using `npm run start`.
6. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
